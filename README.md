# 3Web HyperLedger

This is my first excersise at hyperLedger.Here I`ve made simple tracking system.
Here we have two functions.One for submiting work and the other one is for submiting payment.I generate two keys for the two users.Every function generate transaction in a batch and send it to the ledger.This way we can trac payment and wo
rk done.
